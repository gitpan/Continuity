=for comment

We've got three layers of abstraction here.  Looking at things from the
perspective of the native Web serving platform and moving towards
Continuity's guts, we have:

* Either HTTP::Request or else the FastCGI equiv.

* Continuity::Adapter::HttpServer::Request and 
  Continuity::Adapter::FCGI::Request both present a uniform interface
  to the first type of object, and do HTTP protocol stuff not implemented
  by them, such as parsing GET parameters.
  This of this as the "Continuity::Request" object, except

* Continuity::RequestHolder (this object) is a simple fixed object for 
  the Continuity code hold to hold onto, that knows how to read
  the second sort of object (eg, C::A::H::Request) from a queue and
  delegates calls most tasks to that object.

We should move as much into here as possible, since it is used by all the
different Adaptors.
