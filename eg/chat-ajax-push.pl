# "HTTP Push" is not readily attainable, so instead we will simulate it using a
# long-pull, aka "Comet". The client browser simply opens an HTTP connection to
# the server and waits for a response. The server doesn't respond until there
# is some event (here a new message), giving the appearance of HTTP-push.
#
# Each user gets three continuations for these three cases:
#
#   - Initial load or reload of the page
#   - Sending a message (uses AJAX on the client)
#   - Recieving messages (uses COMET on the client)
