# The idea here is to find a way to deal with the back button well. We will
# send a 302 status between each page. Then we can process their data and give
# them a new ID. When they hit 'back', it doesn't re-processes their data.
#
# Alternatively, maybe the 302 can be used as not just a back-button indicator,
# but as an on-purpose 'block' to keep them from backing out of the site (going
# back past a transaction, for example). The back button would still thus work,
# but only _within_ the site, and we'd have server-side programatic control
# over what happens when people use it.
#
# Or something like that.
