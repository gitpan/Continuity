HTTP::Daemon+Coro

Server Goal:
For the server to be super-minimal and secure.  At a minimum it should do basic
static serving and special app serving.  I'd also like it to do plain CGI. For
fancier things we can use something like perlbal to send other content to
apache.

App Goal:
Apps should be as similar to standard CGI as possible. Its just that they get a
magic yield / suspend / wait-for-input command, and at that point their
environment variables and such get re-initialized. Further abstractions should
be done through libraries and frameworks, but the continuation server shouldn't
care.



2005.10.13 (awwaiid) --------------------------------------------------------

Turned it inside out today, so that now the server serves content on its own
instead of being called from an individual application. Right now I'm just
looking for .pl files to serve as apps, and otherwise am using 'file' to
determine filetypes and just sending things statically.

Doesn't work correctly for abnormal termination, such as loosing your cookie.
Also doesn't work on more than one app.  I guess each app needs its own session
tracking...  using this model doesn't make sense for two different apps to
share the same coro session anyway.
