Continuity version 0.7
======================

Continuity - Abstract away statelessness of HTTP using continuations, for stateful Web applications

Status: It works, using the HTTP::Daemon adaptor at least. Now we're
        stabalizing the API and stabalizing the stabalizers. Lots of debugging
        is turned on.

See Continuity.pm for an overview, and also check the wiki
at http://continuity.tlt42.org/ for ongoing development.
