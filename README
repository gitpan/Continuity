Continuity version 0.996
========================

Continuity - Abstract away statelessness of HTTP using continuations, for
stateful Web applications

Status: Ready for large applications and libraries to be implemented on top, so
        that we can tune the API. Both the HTTP::Daemon and the FCGI backends
        work, though the FCGI backend does not provde fully async coroutines.

See Continuity.pm for an overview, and also check the wiki
at http://continuity.tlt42.org/ for ongoing development.
